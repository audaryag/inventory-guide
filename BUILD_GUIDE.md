# Build guide — click by click

Follow top to bottom. Don't skip ahead; each query references the ones before it.
Every code block you need is in **Appendix A** at the end of this file, under the same
name as the step that asks for it.

Rough time: Part 1–3 about 40 minutes, Part 4 (visuals) about 2 hours.

---

# PART 0 — Set up the folders (10 min)

**0.1** In OneDrive, create this exact structure:

```
Inventory Report\
    RM Raw\
    FG Raw\
    Consble Raw\
    TB\
    Variables and Calculations.xlsx
```

**0.2** Put the `Variables and Calculations.xlsx` I sent you into `Inventory Report\`
(not into a subfolder). Fill in your data rows. Don't rename sheets or headers.

**0.3** Drop your SAP MB5B exports into the three Raw folders. Never edit these files.

**0.4** Rename your TB files to `TB_202601.xlsx`, `TB_202602.xlsx`, etc. (year then month).

**0.5** Get the folder path: open `Inventory Report` in File Explorer, click the address
bar once, copy the whole path. Keep it on your clipboard — you need it in step 1.3.

**0.6** Close every Excel file in these folders. A file open in Excel makes the refresh
fail with a file-lock error. This applies every time you refresh, forever.

---

# PART 1 — Create the queries (30 min)

**1.1** Open **Power BI Desktop** → **Blank report**.

**1.2** Ribbon: **Home** → **Transform data**. The Power Query Editor window opens.
Everything in Part 1 happens in this window.

### How to add each query (you will repeat this 28 times)

1. In Power Query, ribbon: **Home** → **New Source** → **Blank Query**.
2. Ribbon: **Home** → **Advanced Editor**.
3. Select everything in the box (Ctrl+A) and delete it.
4. Paste the code block from Appendix A.
5. Click **Done**.
6. In the **Queries** list on the left, right-click the new query → **Rename** → type the
   exact name from the appendix heading (e.g. `fnCleanMB5B`). **Names must match exactly** —
   the other queries call each other by name.

> You'll see errors like "pRoot not recognised" until the query it depends on exists.
> That's expected. Ignore errors until you've created all of them.

**1.3** Create the queries in **this order**:

| # | Query name | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pRoot` | **Paste YOUR folder path** between the quote marks |
| 2 | `pVarsFile` |  |
| 3 | `fnCleanMB5B` |  |
| 4 | `stgRM` |  |
| 5 | `stgFG` |  |
| 6 | `stgConble` |  |
| 7 | `fnVarSheet` | helper — must exist before the next four |
| 8 | `dimPlant` | hardcoded, reads no sheet |
| 9 | `dimMaterialAttr` |  |
| 10 | `dimFGAttr` |  |
| 11 | `varConstants` | needs a `RM_MW_FACTOR` = 580 row |
| 12 | `fnConstantAsOf` |  |
| 13 | `factRM` |  |
| 14 | `factFG` |  |
| 15 | `factConble` |  |
| 16 | `factInventory` |  |
| 17 | `varMWCapacity` | reads the two-block MW sheet |
| 18 | `dimCapacity` |  |
| 19 | `dimNature` |  |
| 20 | `dimTBMaster` |  |
| 21 | `factTB_Staged` |  |
| 22 | `factTB` |  |
| 23 | `factTB_Unmapped` |  |
| 24 | `dimDate` |  |
| 25 | `qcHeaders` | self-check |
| 26 | `qcVarHeaders` | self-check |
| 27 | `qcNatureNoCapacity` | self-check |
| 28 | `qcMWSheet` | self-check — shows the MW sheet raw |

**1.4** If Power BI asks about **privacy levels** or **credentials**, choose
**Organizational** for OneDrive and click through. If it warns about combining data
sources, click **Ignore Privacy Levels** (it's all your own data).

**1.5 — Important.** Turn off loading for the helper queries. For **each** of these,
right-click the query in the left list and **untick "Enable load"**:

```
pRoot, pVarsFile, fnCleanMB5B, stgRM, stgFG, stgConble,
fnVarSheet, factRM, factFG, factConble, varConstants,
fnConstantAsOf, varMWCapacity, factTB_Staged
```

Leave these ticked (they become your tables):
```
factInventory, factTB, factTB_Unmapped, dimPlant, dimDate,
dimNature, dimCapacity, dimTBMaster, dimMaterialAttr, dimFGAttr,
qcHeaders, qcVarHeaders, qcNatureNoCapacity, qcMWSheet
```

**1.6** Ribbon: **Home** → **Close & Apply**. Wait for it to load.

### If something fails here

| Error message | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Column 'X' of the table wasn't found" | a header in Excel doesn't match the code | fix the spelling in Excel to match the code, or tell me and I'll change the code |
| "The key didn't match any rows" | a sheet name is wrong | check sheet names: `RM Nature`, `FG Master`, `MW Capacity`, `Constants`, `TB Master`, `Plant Master` |
| "We couldn't find folder" | `pRoot` path is wrong | recheck step 0.5; no trailing backslash |
| "The file is being used by another process" | an Excel file is open | close all Excel files; check Task Manager for a stray EXCEL.EXE; delete any `~$` file |
| "Illegal characters in path" | `pRoot` is not your real path | open the folder in File Explorer, click the address bar, copy it in — keep the quote marks |
| "Token Literal expected" | a text value lost its quote marks | `pRoot` must be `"C:\...\Inventory Report"`, quotes included |
| "Not enough elements in the enumeration" | a query assumed more columns than the sheet has | you are on an old version of the query — refresh the guide page and re-copy |
| "Expression.Syntax Error" right after pasting | the whole appendix went into one query | one query per Blank Query, 28 times |

Send me the exact error text and I'll tell you the one-line fix.

# PART 2 — Build the model (10 min)

**2.1** Left sidebar: click the **Model** icon (third one down, looks like a table diagram).

**2.2** Power BI will have guessed some relationships. **Delete all of them**: click each
connecting line and press Delete. Cleaner to start blank.

**2.3** Create these 8 relationships. To create one: click and drag the **from** field onto
the **to** field. Then double-click the line and confirm the settings.

| From (the "one" side) | To (the "many" side) | Cardinality | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dimDate[Month]` | `factInventory[Month]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimDate[Month]` | `factTB[Month]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimDate[Month]` | `dimCapacity[Month]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimPlant[ValuationArea]` | `factInventory[ValuationArea]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimPlant[ValuationArea]` | `factTB[ValuationArea]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimPlant[ValuationArea]` | `dimCapacity[ValuationArea]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimNature[Nature]` | `factInventory[Nature]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimNature[Nature]` | `dimCapacity[Tech]` | One to many | Single |
| `dimTBMaster[GLAccount]` | `factTB[GLAccount]` | One to many | Single |

Every one is **Single** direction. If Power BI offers "Both", don't take it — bidirectional
relationships cause wrong totals in ways that are very hard to spot later.

**2.4** Skip "Mark as date table" — it needs one row per *day*, and `dimDate` is monthly on
purpose. None of the measures need it; `Value ₹ Cr LM` uses `MonthIndex` instead.

**2.5** Fix month sorting: click the `MonthName` column in `dimDate` → ribbon
**Column tools** → **Sort by column** → pick `MonthSort`. Without this, months sort
alphabetically (Apr, Aug, Dec…) and every chart reads as nonsense.

**2.6** Do the same for `dimPlant`: click `Plant` → **Sort by column** → `PlantSort`.

**2.7** Hide the plumbing so the Fields list stays usable. Right-click → **Hide** on:
`factInventory[MatKey]`, `factTB[PlantCode]`, `dimDate[MonthSort]`, `dimPlant[PlantSort]`.

---

# PART 3 — Add the measures (15 min)

**3.1** Left sidebar: click the **Report** icon (top one).

**3.2** In the Fields pane, click `factInventory` once to select it.

**3.3** Ribbon: **Home** → **New measure**. A formula bar appears at the top.

**3.4** Delete what's there, paste **one** measure from Appendix B, press **Enter**.

**3.5** Repeat 3.3–3.4 for every measure in Appendix B. One at a time — Power BI takes one
measure per box.

**3.6** Everything money is already in **crore rupees** and named to say so
(`Value ₹ Cr`, `TB ₹ Cr`, …), so no currency symbol is needed. Click each ₹ Cr measure →
ribbon **Measure tools** → **Format: Decimal number**, **Decimal places: 2**.
For `MW`, `FG MW`, `Capacity MW`, `Days of Inventory`, use **Decimal places: 1**.
For every `%` measure use **Format: Percentage**, 1 decimal.

**3.7** If you built an earlier version of this file, the old names are gone: `Closing Value`
became `Value ₹ Cr`, `Inv RM/FG/Consumables` became `RM/FG/Consumables ₹ Cr`, `TB Value`
became `TB ₹ Cr`, `Days` became `Days of Inventory`, `Prev Month` became `Value ₹ Cr LM`.
Delete the old measures (right-click → Delete) after the new ones exist, or visuals will
still point at the old ones.

---

# PART 4 — Build the pages

Each visual is spelled out the same way: what to insert, which field goes in which
well, and the four numbers that place it on a 1280 x 720 canvas.

> Prefer one instruction at a time? Use the **Build it** tab — same content, one step per screen, with a Next button.

**To place any visual:** select it → Format pane → General → Properties →
**Size and style** → type X, Y, Width, Height.

**4.0 Canvas and theme, before anything else.**

1. Click empty canvas → Format pane → Canvas settings → Type 16:9, Height 720, Width 1280.
2. Download [inventory-theme.json](inventory-theme.json) (right-click → Save link as).
3. Ribbon **View** → **Themes** → **Browse for themes** → pick that file.

Colours, fonts, borders and card styling all come from the theme, so nothing below
asks you to colour anything.

**Create the five pages** with the **+** at the bottom, named: `Overview` · `Summary` · `FG` · `RM` · `Data Quality`.

---

## The header band — build once on Overview, then copy

**4.1** Five **Card** visuals (**Insert → Card**), one measure each:

| Card | Measure | X | Y | Width | Height |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Total value ₹ Cr | `Value ₹ Cr` | 16 | 12 | 200 | 88 |
| 2 — Raw materials ₹ Cr | `RM ₹ Cr` | 224 | 12 | 200 | 88 |
| 3 — Finished goods ₹ Cr | `FG ₹ Cr` | 432 | 12 | 200 | 88 |
| 4 — Consumables ₹ Cr | `Consumables ₹ Cr` | 640 | 12 | 200 | 88 |
| 5 — FG days of inventory | `Days of Inventory` | 848 | 12 | 200 | 88 |
| 6 — Change vs last month | `Value ₹ Cr % vs LM` | 1056 | 12 | 208 | 88 |

**4.2** Two **Slicer** visuals (**Insert → Slicer**), each set to
**Format → Slicer settings → Style: Dropdown**:

| Slicer | Field | X | Y | Width | Height |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Month | `dimDate[MonthName]` | 16 | 108 | 300 | 44 |
| Plant | `dimPlant[Plant]` | 324 | 108 | 300 | 44 |
| Category | `factInventory[Category]` | 632 | 108 | 300 | 44 |

**4.3** Select all seven → **Ctrl+C** → on each other page **Ctrl+V**. Positions come with them.

**4.4** Ribbon **View** → tick **Sync slicers**; for each slicer tick **Sync** and
**Visible** on all five pages. Without it, two pages can disagree about the same month.

---

## Page — Overview

**4.5** **Stacked column chart** — Every month side by side, split RM / FG / consumables.

| Well | Field |
|---|---|
| X-axis | `dimDate[MonthName]` |
| Y-axis | `Value ₹ Cr` |
| Legend | `factInventory[Category]` |

Title: `Value ₹ Cr by month and category`

# PART 5 — Publish and hand over

**5.1** Ribbon **Home** → **Publish** → sign in → pick or create a workspace.

- If it lets you pick a workspace, you have Power BI Pro. Good.
- If it asks you to start a trial, you don't have Pro. Ask IT to assign a licence —
  otherwise you can only email the .pbix file and it won't refresh on its own.

**5.2** In the browser at app.powerbi.com, open the workspace → find the dataset →
**Settings** → **Scheduled refresh** → turn on, set a daily time.

**5.3** Give your successor access: workspace → **Access** → add their email as
**Member** (Member, not Viewer, so they can edit after you've gone).

**5.4** Tell them the two permanent rules:
1. Close all Excel files before refreshing.
2. On `MW Capacity` and `Constants`, never overwrite a number — add a new row with the
   date it takes effect. Overwriting silently rewrites past months.

---

# Monthly routine, once it's live

1. Drop the new MB5B exports into the three Raw folders.
2. Drop the new TB in as `TB_YYYYMM.xlsx`.
3. Add any new materials to `RM Nature` / `FG Master`.
4. If capacity or a constant changed, add a **new row** with the effective date.
5. Open the .pbix → **Refresh**. Check the Data Quality page.

That's it. No formulas to drag down, no SUMIFS to extend.


---

# Appendix A — all query code

Each heading below is ONE separate query. For each: **Home → New Source → Blank Query**, then **Home → Advanced Editor**, Ctrl+A, Delete, paste the block, **Done**, then right-click the query → **Rename** and type the heading name exactly.

Do not paste this whole appendix into one editor — that is a syntax error.

Errors are normal until every query exists, because they reference each other.

## pRoot

> Replace the whole path with YOUR real folder path. Keep the quote marks. No trailing backslash. No angle brackets.

```

## pVarsFile

```
pRoot & "\Variables and Calculations.xlsx"

# Appendix B — measures

Add these one at a time (**Home → New measure**), with `factInventory` selected. Copy the
whole block each time — several measures build on the ones above them, so keep the order.

Everything money is in **crore rupees** and named so a reader knows what it is without asking.
`SUM(...)/10000000` is the crore conversion.

*value, as at the end of the selected month*

```
Value ₹ Cr = DIVIDE(SUM(factInventory[CloseVal]), 10000000)
```

```
As On = "as on " & FORMAT(EOMONTH(MAX(dimDate[Month]), 0), "dd MMM yyyy")
```

```
Value ₹ Cr Title = "Value ₹ Cr " & [As On]
```

```
Opening Value ₹ Cr = DIVIDE(SUM(factInventory[OpenVal]), 10000000)
```

```
Receipts ₹ Cr = DIVIDE(SUM(factInventory[ReceiptVal]), 10000000)
```

```
Issues ₹ Cr = DIVIDE(SUM(factInventory[IssueVal]), 10000000)
```

```
Closing Qty = SUM(factInventory[CloseQty])
```

*by category*

```
RM ₹ Cr = CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], factInventory[Category] = "RM")
```

```
FG ₹ Cr = CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], factInventory[Category] = "FG")
```

```
Consumables ₹ Cr = CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], factInventory[Category] = "Consumables")
```

```
Share of Total % = DIVIDE([Value ₹ Cr], CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], ALL(factInventory[Category])))
```

*megawatts and days*

```
MW = SUM(factInventory[MW])
```

```
FG MW = CALCULATE([MW], factInventory[Category] = "FG")
```

```
Capacity MW = SUM(dimCapacity[CapacityMW])
```

*Days is FG only: capacity is module capacity, so RM and consumables have no*

*meaningful denominator. Scoping it here stops a plausible-looking but meaningless*

*number appearing if someone drops it on the RM page.*

```
Days of Inventory = DIVIDE([FG MW], [Capacity MW])
```

```
INR per Wp = SUM(factInventory[INR_WP])
```

*month-on-month and year-on-year comparison*

```
Value ₹ Cr LM =
VAR PrevIdx = MAX(dimDate[MonthIndex]) - 1
RETURN CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], ALL(dimDate), dimDate[MonthIndex] = PrevIdx)
```

```
Value ₹ Cr vs LM = [Value ₹ Cr] - [Value ₹ Cr LM]
```

```
Value ₹ Cr % vs LM = DIVIDE([Value ₹ Cr vs LM], [Value ₹ Cr LM])
```

```
Value ₹ Cr LY =
VAR PrevIdx = MAX(dimDate[MonthIndex]) - 12
RETURN CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], ALL(dimDate), dimDate[MonthIndex] = PrevIdx)
```

```
Value ₹ Cr % vs LY = DIVIDE([Value ₹ Cr] - [Value ₹ Cr LY], [Value ₹ Cr LY])
```

```
MW LM =
VAR PrevIdx = MAX(dimDate[MonthIndex]) - 1
RETURN CALCULATE([MW], ALL(dimDate), dimDate[MonthIndex] = PrevIdx)
```

```
MW vs LM = [MW] - [MW LM]
```

```
Days LM =
VAR PrevIdx = MAX(dimDate[MonthIndex]) - 1
RETURN CALCULATE([Days of Inventory], ALL(dimDate), dimDate[MonthIndex] = PrevIdx)
```

```
Days vs LM = [Days of Inventory] - [Days LM]
```

*peak, average and latest across whatever months are in view*

```
Avg Value ₹ Cr = AVERAGEX(VALUES(dimDate[MonthIndex]), [Value ₹ Cr])
```

```
Peak Value ₹ Cr = MAXX(VALUES(dimDate[MonthIndex]), [Value ₹ Cr])
```

```
Latest Month Value ₹ Cr =
VAR LastIdx = CALCULATE(MAX(dimDate[MonthIndex]), ALLSELECTED(dimDate))
RETURN CALCULATE([Value ₹ Cr], dimDate[MonthIndex] = LastIdx)
```

*trial balance reconciliation*

```
TB ₹ Cr = DIVIDE(SUM(factTB[Amount]), 10000000)
```

```
Difference ₹ Cr = [TB ₹ Cr] - [Value ₹ Cr]
```

```
Difference % = DIVIDE([Difference ₹ Cr], [TB ₹ Cr])
```

*data quality*

```
Stock Recon ₹ Cr = [Opening Value ₹ Cr] + [Receipts ₹ Cr] - [Issues ₹ Cr] - [Value ₹ Cr]
```

```
Rows Missing Attr = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(factInventory), factInventory[AttrMissing] = TRUE())
```

```
Unmapped TB ₹ Cr = DIVIDE(SUM(factTB_Unmapped[Amount]), 10000000)
```

*formatting, once all of the above exist*

Select each money measure → **Measure tools** → **Format: Decimal number**, 2 decimals.
For `Days of Inventory` and `MW` use 1 decimal. For the `%` measures use **Percentage**,
1 decimal. `Share of Total %` and `Difference %` both read better as percentages than as
raw ratios, and a reader can't tell the difference from the number alone.
